# LexisNexis Prompt Builder (No APIs)

A Streamlit app that generates **role- and industry-tailored prompts** for LexisNexis Customer Success / Relationship Management / Sales Consulting.  
It uses **no external APIs** — just structured templates and local logic — so you can safely deploy in environments that prohibit external model calls.

This version includes **improved Chinese copy** and **multilingual tone templates** for natural, business-ready phrasing.

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud
Push to GitHub and point Streamlit at `app.py`.
